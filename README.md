Predicting auction sale prices of bulldozers using machine learning
This project uses the Bluebook for Bulldozers dataset sourced from Kaggle’s competition to build a model that predicts the sale price of heavy machinery based on its historical auction data and features. The problem is treated as a supervised regression task.
Dataset


Dataset used: Bluebook for Bulldozers (Kaggle Competition)


Files included
